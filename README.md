In Holbies Hectic Hysteria you play as Holbie the seahorse and you have to navigate your way through a polluted ocean in order to put a stop to it all

## Devlog
this was my year1 capstone project from holberton school. I decided to develop this project in unity/c# as the next year when specializations started I had chosen to pursue ar/vr development and that course is done entirely in unity/c# this project was develop with a team but the team sort of fell apart halfway through the project development so in this devlog I will just talk about my side of it. At the start of this project I had never used unity before and I had never programmed in c# before. I was tasked with player movement, object interaction, player offense ability, scorekeeping/display, level transitions, health display, UI, sprite design/animation, and at least one enemy AI design. It was quite challenging to say the least I started at holberton with very limited knowledge of programming and this was a big leap  from the languages I had practice from year 1 ultimately though im grateful for the experience

## Future plans
I don't really have any future plans for this repo or version of HHH as I want to keep as a marker for how far I've come since starting holberton and how far I will develop since this project. I will probably revise this again sometimne down the rode for nostalgia purposes
